  I wanted to create an application for ordering food while staying at home. 
So far only one page is available in the application, namely the pizza section (I did not have enough time to finalize the rest) but this will be fixed in the future.
  Each section presents an assortment of food and a choice of its size, you can also make an instant purchase.
There are 6 sections in the application: 3 of them food, 2 settings and dashboard.
  Problems arose when synchronizing images with Intelij IDEA and Scene Builder.
Participated in the development: Intelij IDEA, JavaFX, Scene Builder.
